# bikesharing

## Overview
Convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

## Results
The Tableau story can be seen in the following link:

To start off we should take a look at exactly who is using CitiBike.

In the image above we can see that most of CitiBike customers are male subscribers. While only about 25% are female customers, with a small portion of the users gender are unknown.

The map above shows the bike stations from which the users bike trip started. The bigger and darker the circle is, the more trips have started in that location. The image indicates that most of the trips start in the densely packed part of the city. While in more of the rural areas CitiBike isnt used nearly as much.

This next image displays how many users are riding by the hour for the month of August. As you can see the peak time with the most bikes out are between 5 and 6pm. While the least busy time are between mdinight to 5am. Therefore midnight to 5am would be a great time to do any bike repairs and redistribute the bikes if need be.

![2022-04-16 (3)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163690773-f0f587d2-e4f1-40e3-97fd-fa11be545a72.png)

The heat map above shows us the usage of bikes throughtout the week instead of just by the hour. As we can see Thursday between 5 and 6pm is the most busy time. Which makes sense and helps confirm the findings from the image before this one.

![2022-04-16 (4)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163690968-f68076de-c654-4fca-8feb-b6982e0406a6.png)

This image tell us what bikes get used more then others. The bigger boxes that are more red have been used more then the smaller boxes that are more black. From this we can conclude which bike will need more repairs because they are used much more, while the lesser used bike wont need as many repairs as often.

![2022-04-16 (6)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163691151-27c88ad6-8381-4c14-8bd1-743aaaaa383b.png)

The graph above helps us see not only how old the customers are but how long they traveled on their trip. As we can see costumers are all ages from young to old. In addition most trips last around 12min.

![2022-04-16 (7)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163691263-8362be7e-fd60-4ca6-a8f0-5217e69abd38.png)

This graph helps us see amount of rides customers take compared to the length. Yet again the  most common duration of the ride is only around 15min but we can now see that over 140k costumers ride for only about 15min.

![2022-04-16 (8)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163691414-872663d5-d2c3-4384-bb02-61bfbb387c1e.png)

This image again shows us that the most common duration of the trip is around 15min but we can now see what genders the customers are. The take away being its doesnt make much of a difference being male, female or unknown they all have a 15min trip duration, there is just alot more males then females, or unknowns.

![2022-04-16 (9)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94339449/163691503-1d1ad5b5-6187-4168-80c8-efbba62d2c5a.png)

Lastly, this heatmap reinforces how much of the userbase is dominated by male-identifying, subscribing users.

## Summary

In conclusion, bikeshare services are remarkably popular in busy metropolitan areas, where occupied real estate is densely packed and parking spaces may be scarce. The user base is made up mostly of male subscribers, providing regular income to the program. More outreach should be done to attract female riders, but male users seem a reliable market. And main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times.

If I were to pursue additional lines of inquiry for analysis and visualization, given the data provided, I would explore:

trip starting and ending locations during morning and evening rush hour time-windows, to display the flow of traffic between neighborhoods at peak hours;
average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore if there was any difference in male or female or un-gendered riders as they age.
